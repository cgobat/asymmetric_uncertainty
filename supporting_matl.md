- The probability distribution used by this package to model asymmetrically uncertain quantities is given in Eq. (2) of Starling, et al. (2008).[^1] As it happens, this paper's methodology partially inspired the creation of this package in the first place.
- [@muryelgp](https://github.com/muryelgp)'s [`asymmetric_uncertainties`](https://github.com/muryelgp/asymmetric_uncertainties) package, which (as the name suggests) has some similar functionality to this, but uses Monte Carlo methods rather than an empirical/analytical function to model the error distributions. The methodology is described in Barlow (2004).[^2]
- This package has been used in two of my own works: [cgobat/dark-GRBs](https://github.com/cgobat/dark-GRBs) and [cgobat/XDBS](https://github.com/cgobat/XDBS).[^3]
